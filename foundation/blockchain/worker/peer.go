// main.go represent the origin node. That node must be running first.
// All new peer nodes connect to the origin node to identify all other
// peers on the network. The topology is all nodes having a connection
// to all other nodes. If a node does not respond to a network call,
// they are removed from the peer list until the next peer operation.

// addNewPeers takes the list of known peers and makes sure they are
// included in the nodes list of known peers.
